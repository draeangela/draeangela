    * Which openings are considered "good" for white and black based on win rates?
    * Do more developed openings correlate with higher win percentages?
    * Is there a correlation between an opening's popularity and its success rate?
    * Which openings are most commonly used by top-rated players?

    Methods and solutions can be found in the file Writeup.txt within the repository.
* **Tech Stack:** Java
* **Repository:** 

#### 5. Boggle Game Replica
